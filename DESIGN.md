# Codex Client Design Reference

## Purpose

This document defines the shared design for the `codex-client` project family.

The project is intended to support multiple language bindings over time. Python exists today. TypeScript and Rust are planned. This document is written to be language agnostic and should remain valid even as individual bindings evolve.

`DESIGN.md` is for contributors and maintainers who need to understand:

- the Codex app-server protocol model at a high level
- the architectural layers each binding should implement
- the invariants that should remain consistent across languages

It is not the primary installation or quickstart guide. Language-specific READMEs should own setup instructions, examples, and binding-specific API details.

## Canonical Sources

The repository has three different documentation roles:

- `schema/` is the source of truth for wire format, request and response shapes, and protocol type definitions.
- `DESIGN.md` explains protocol semantics, layering, and cross-language design constraints.
- Language-specific READMEs explain how to install, use, and contribute to a specific binding.

When these sources appear to disagree:

1. `schema/` wins for protocol shape and field-level truth.
2. `DESIGN.md` wins for shared architectural intent and behavioral invariants.
3. Language READMEs win for binding-local usage and ergonomics.

## Design Goals

The project should optimize for the following:

1. **One protocol, many bindings**
   Each binding should represent the same app-server concepts and lifecycle, even when the surface API is idiomatic to its language.

2. **Progressive abstraction**
   Users should be able to choose between a low-level protocol layer, a typed request layer, and a higher-level workflow/runtime layer.

3. **Schema-driven correctness**
   Protocol types and method coverage should be derived from checked-in schemas whenever practical.

4. **Small semantic gap to the wire**
   Higher layers may improve ergonomics, but they should not hide protocol rules in ways that make debugging or cross-language parity difficult.

5. **Clear escape hatches**
   Each higher layer should be implemented in terms of the lower layer and should expose a path downward when callers need more control.

6. **Cross-language consistency**
   Python, TypeScript, Rust, and future bindings may differ in naming and idioms, but they should preserve the same core behavior and lifecycle semantics.

## Protocol Overview

### Transport

The Codex app-server protocol is a bidirectional JSON-RPC-style protocol carried over a stream transport.

Today the important transport model is:

- local stdio transport for spawning `codex app-server`
- optionally other framed transports when supported by the server

Bindings should treat transport as an abstraction. The rest of the client stack should not depend on a specific process or socket implementation.

### Message Model

Messages fall into three categories:

- requests, which include an `id` and expect a response
- responses, which resolve a prior request
- notifications, which do not expect a response

The protocol also includes server-to-client requests for approvals, tool input, and similar host-driven actions. Bindings must model those as first-class protocol events rather than pretending the client is the only request sender.

### Core Conversation Model

The protocol centers on three nested objects:

```text
Thread
  -> Turn
     -> Item
```

- A **Thread** is a conversation container.
- A **Turn** is one unit of user input plus the agent work that follows.
- An **Item** is a streamed or completed unit of work inside a turn, such as a message, command execution, file change, tool call, or reasoning artifact.

Bindings should preserve this model directly. Higher-level conveniences should build on it rather than replace it with a different conceptual structure.

### Lifecycle

At a high level, a session follows this order:

1. Establish transport to the app-server.
2. Send `initialize`.
3. Send `initialized` after the initialize response.
4. Start, resume, or otherwise select a thread.
5. Start a turn on that thread.
6. Consume streaming notifications and server requests until turn completion.
7. Optionally continue the thread, fork it, archive it, or close the session.

Bindings must preserve these protocol ordering requirements. High-level APIs may automate them, but they must not violate them.

### Capability Groups

The protocol surface is broad, but most methods fit into a small set of groups:

- session and initialization
- thread lifecycle
- turn lifecycle
- review flows
- command execution
- configuration and model discovery
- authentication and account state
- skills, apps, and MCP integration

`DESIGN.md` does not attempt to restate every endpoint. The schemas are authoritative for exact method names and payloads. This document only captures the behavior that should shape every binding.

### Streaming Semantics

The app-server is fundamentally streaming oriented.

Bindings should preserve:

- incremental deltas for long-running work
- authoritative completion events
- ordering guarantees within a connection
- the distinction between partial output and final item or turn state

A runtime layer may offer convenience helpers such as “wait for final text”, but it should still be possible to consume the underlying event stream directly.

### Approvals and Host Participation

The host is not a passive observer. The server may ask the client to:

- approve or reject command execution
- approve or reject file changes
- answer tool-input questions
- execute client-owned dynamic tools

Bindings must provide a clear way to handle these server requests.

Recommended shared behavior:

- approval-capable runtimes should be fail-closed by default unless the caller explicitly opts into permissive behavior
- bindings should expose convenience helpers for common approval responses
- lower layers should still allow callers to respond with raw protocol-shaped data when necessary

### Error Model

Protocol failures can occur at multiple levels:

- transport failures
- malformed protocol messages
- request/response mismatches
- turn-level failures reported by the server
- approval or host-callback failures

Bindings should keep these categories distinguishable. A caller should be able to tell whether a failure came from the transport, the protocol machinery, or the server-reported turn result.

## Shared SDK Layering

Each binding should preserve the same three conceptual layers.

## Layer 1: Protocol Core

The Protocol Core owns the raw protocol boundary:

- transport abstraction
- message framing and parsing
- raw request, response, and notification flow

Responsibilities:

- send and receive raw protocol messages
- preserve ordering and payload fidelity
- surface malformed frames and transport failures clearly
- stay close to the wire format

Non-goals:

- workflow helpers
- thread or turn state modeling
- approval policy abstractions
- opinionated retries or orchestration

This layer should remain small and unsurprising.

## Layer 2: Typed Protocol Client

The Typed Protocol Client owns typed protocol interaction:

- typed request methods for client-to-server methods
- request ID allocation and pending-response tracking
- notification dispatch
- server-request dispatch
- middleware or interception hooks where appropriate for the language

Responsibilities:

- represent protocol methods and types in a language-idiomatic way
- correlate responses to requests correctly
- surface notifications and server requests as typed events or callbacks
- support direct access to the full protocol surface without adding workflow opinions

Non-goals:

- hiding protocol sequencing in ways that make debugging difficult
- introducing a second domain model for threads and turns
- embedding binding-specific business logic in middleware

This layer is the escape hatch for callers who need full protocol control without handling raw JSON-RPC plumbing themselves.

## Layer 3: Session Runtime

The Session Runtime owns high-level workflow ergonomics:

- session lifecycle
- thread objects
- turn objects
- approval policy integration
- convenience helpers for common ask-and-wait flows

Responsibilities:

- make the common host workflow concise
- keep local thread and turn state aligned with server notifications
- provide streaming and final-result access patterns
- expose policy hooks for approvals and tool interaction

Non-goals:

- inventing behavior that diverges from the underlying protocol
- making lower layers inaccessible
- forcing one concurrency or event-consumption style on every caller

The runtime should be implemented in terms of the typed client layer, and the typed client should be implemented in terms of the protocol core.

## Cross-Language Binding Principles

Bindings should preserve the same conceptual model, even when they use different language idioms.

### What Should Stay Consistent

- protocol lifecycle and ordering rules
- meaning of threads, turns, items, approvals, and completion
- coverage of the protocol surface
- distinction between low-level, typed, and runtime layers
- ability to stream output incrementally
- ability to handle server-originated requests

### What May Differ By Language

- exact class, trait, module, package, or function names
- sync versus async surface details, where the language ecosystem strongly prefers one pattern
- callback, stream, iterator, channel, or future-based event delivery APIs
- packaging layout and generated-code organization

Language idioms are allowed. Semantic drift is not.

### Type Generation

Bindings should derive protocol types from `schema/` whenever practical.

Acceptable implementation differences:

- one binding may use generated source files
- another may generate only selected typed wrappers
- another may mix generated protocol types with handwritten ergonomic helpers

The important invariant is that schema changes should map predictably into binding behavior and public typed surfaces.

### Middleware and Extensibility

Not every language needs identical middleware APIs, but bindings should support cross-cutting concerns such as:

- logging
- tracing
- recording or replay
- approval instrumentation
- metrics or debugging hooks

If a binding exposes middleware, it should do so at the typed-client boundary rather than inside the runtime convenience layer.

### Escape Hatches

A caller using the runtime layer should still be able to access the lower layers when needed.

Examples of valid escape hatches:

- access to the underlying typed client
- access to raw notifications or server requests
- direct construction of a typed client from a transport

The exact API can be idiomatic to the language, but the capability should exist.

## Binding Status

The project is intended to grow as a family of bindings over time.

Current and planned status:

- **Python**: implemented today
- **TypeScript**: planned
- **Rust**: planned

The goal is not identical APIs across languages. The goal is equivalent conceptual layers and protocol behavior.

A new binding should aim to provide:

1. a protocol core
2. a typed protocol client
3. a runtime layer, if the host ecosystem benefits from it

If a binding ships in stages, it is acceptable to start with the lower layers first. The binding should document which layers are present and which are intentionally deferred.

## Maintenance Rules

When the protocol evolves:

1. update `schema/` first
2. update bindings to match the new schema behavior
3. update `DESIGN.md` only when the change affects shared semantics, lifecycle expectations, or architecture

This file should not accumulate:

- binding-specific quickstarts
- speculative repository trees
- one-off implementation plans
- stale counts of generated files or schema totals

If a detail is likely to change often and is already encoded precisely in schemas or binding docs, prefer linking to that source instead of duplicating it here.

## Practical Reading Order

For someone new to the repository:

1. read the language-specific README you plan to use
2. read `DESIGN.md` if you need the shared architecture or protocol model
3. inspect `schema/` when you need exact wire-level details

For someone implementing a new binding:

1. start with `DESIGN.md`
2. use `schema/` as the protocol contract
3. compare the existing Python binding for one concrete implementation of the shared model
